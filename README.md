# Minibank

// The Idea
To develop a banking application with user interface and operations such as login, create account, deposit, withdraw and money transfer between accounts.

// The Development
We start creating the first steps of the user interface using prompt-view library, with a navigation menu leading to submenus of the choosen options.
In the next step we implemented it with Model-View-Controller architecture, separating the aplication in different layers.
Later we implemented a Service layer and Data Access Objects layers to a better responsability separation when implementing data persistence. Wich came in the next step using MySQL.
Further on we implemented Spring framework for transactions, entity management and REST operations.
Finally we added frontend using html, css (bootstrap) and JavaScript.
